# ABNAMRO Assessment (max 4 hours)
Introduction
-
This assessment consists of **4** assignments.
Each assignment focuses on different aspects of Java programming, aspects common in corporate environments, like testing, exception handling, etc...

> Important: There is no wrong or right. Many different paths lead to success!

Before you start
- Install the [GitPod Extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/), if not already installed
- Login to Github
- [F1] is the most **important** key in the online IDE (VSCode)!
- Set the timer before **each** assignment: [F1] > start timer
- You may **install** additional VSCode extensions from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode)
- After each assignment, **commit & push!**, take a 10 min break and some coffee ;-) 

>Some useful hints

>- invoke http requests: curl -v --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"name":"xyz","birthDate":"xyz"}' http://localhost:8080/
>- on the lefthand-side hit ![source control](fork.png "source control") to manage git
>- on the righthand-side hit ![github](github.png) to fork and push your code
>- but also F1, type 'git' and all git commands are to your avail...
